TITLE: Show HN: Claude CodePro – Professional development environment for Claude Code

---

Hi HN,

I've been using Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI) for a few months and kept running into the same issues:

1. No enforcement of TDD or quality checks - Claude writes untested code if you let it
2. Context window fills up mid-feature, losing all the understanding Claude built up
3. Starting fresh sessions means re-explaining the codebase
4. Setting up a good configuration takes time

I built Claude CodePro to address these for my own freelance work. Sharing it in case others find it useful.

TWO WAYS TO WORK

1. /spec "your feature" - For larger work
   - Creates an implementation plan as markdown
   - You review and approve before implementation
   - TDD enforcement via pre-edit hook
   - Verification step at the end

2. Quick Mode - Just chat
   - No planning overhead
   - Quality hooks still run
   - Good for bug fixes and small changes

ENDLESS MODE

One of the main features is automatic context continuation. When you hit ~90% of the 200K context window, the system:

- Saves current state to a continuation file
- Captures observations via Claude Mem (persistent memory MCP)
- Triggers a session restart
- New session reads the saved state and continues

I've had features span multiple session handoffs without manually managing anything.

QUALITY HOOKS

Post-edit hooks run automatically:
- Python: ruff, basedpyright
- TypeScript: eslint, tsc, prettier
- All languages: QLTY
- Inline comments get stripped (Claude adds too many)

Pre-edit hook warns if you're modifying code without a failing test first.

DEV CONTAINER

Everything runs in a Dev Container. Advantages:

- Consistent environment across all machines and operating systems
- Complete isolation from your host system
- Complex toolchain (LSP servers, semantic search, linters) just works
- No manual installation of dependencies
- Easy onboarding - works immediately after container starts
- Reproducible setup every time

INCLUDED TOOLS

- Vexor: Local semantic code search
- Claude Mem: Persistent memory across sessions
- Context7: Library documentation retrieval
- Firecrawl: Web scraping
- agent-browser: Headless Chromium for browser automation
- mcp-cli: CLI for custom MCP servers

WHAT IT IS

Configuration, hooks, rules, and tooling for Claude Code. The AI is still Claude via Anthropic's API - you need your own key.

I'm a freelance developer near Munich. Built this for my own projects and figured others might benefit.
