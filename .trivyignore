# Trivy ignore file
# Add CVE IDs or secret rule IDs here to suppress specific findings.
#
# Format:
#   CVE-2024-12345                     # Suppress a specific CVE
#   generic-api-key:path/to/file.txt   # Suppress a secret finding in a specific file
#
# Note: launcher/ and docs/site/api/ are excluded from scanning via skip-dirs
# in the workflow because they are git-crypt encrypted — their binary content
# would produce false-positive secret detections.
